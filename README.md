|Chapter|Topic|Image|Description|
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|1| How to Read Image or Video-Webcam| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter1.gif" width="300" height="150" /> | Learn how to read images videos and webcam.  </br> |
|2| 5 Must Know OpenCV Basic Functions| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter2.gif" width="300" height="150" /> |     5 Must know opencv functions for beginners. Gray Scale, Blur, Edge Detection, Dialation and Erosion.  </br> |
|3| How to Crop and Resize Images| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter3.gif" width="300" height="150" /> |   How to crop and resize and iamge. Resize could be used to scale up or scale down an image where cropping can be used to get a part of the image. </br> |
|4| How to Draw Shapes and Text| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter4.gif" width="300" height="150" /> |      Learn to create blank images along with how to draw Lines, rectangles, circles and custom text.   </br> |
|5| Warp Prespective/BirdView| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter5.gif" width="300" height="150" />  |      Learn how to creat a warp prespective of a selected area of an image using fixed points.   </br> |
|6| Joining Multiple Images to Display| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter6.gif" width="300" height="150" /> |      Join multiple images together as one image for easy visualization of the workflow. Learn how to do it for smaller noumber of images and how it could be scaled up to have several images in the same image.   </br> |
|7| Color Detection| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter7.gif" width="300" height="150" />   |How to detect any color in an image using the HSV space with the help of opencv Trackbars.  </br> |
|8| Contour/Shape Detection| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter8.gif" width="300" height="150" />      |How to detect shapes of objects by finding their contours. Contours are basically outline that bound the shape or form of an object. So we will be detecting multiple shapes and how many corners points each shape has along with its area .   </br> |
|9| Face Detection| <img src="https://github.com/Jobar86/objectrecognition_course/blob/main/Tumbnails/Chapter9.gif" width="300" height="150" />   |How to detect faces in realtime using Viola Jones method.   </br> |
